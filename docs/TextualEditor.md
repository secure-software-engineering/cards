# Textual Editor

The textual editor of this toolsuite is built using Xtext.

For examples of our DSL, refer to the documentation of the model and security definitions.
If you want to get started building your own component model instance, we highly recommend taking a look at our [User Guide](https://github.com/jogeismann/securedataflowdsl/blob/develop/docs/UserGuide.md).
